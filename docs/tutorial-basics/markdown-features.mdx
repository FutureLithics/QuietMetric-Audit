# Markdown Features

Docusaurus supports **[Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)** and a few **additional features**.

## Front Matter

Markdown documents have metadata at the top called [Front Matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/):

```text title="my-doc.md"
// highlight-start
---
id: my-doc-id
title: My document title
description: My document description
slug: /my-custom-url
---
// highlight-end

## Markdown heading

Markdown text with [links](./hello.md)
```

## Links

Regular Markdown links are supported, using url paths or relative file paths.

```md
Let's see how to [Create a page](/create-a-page).
```

```md
Let's see how to [Create a page](./create-a-page.md).
```

**Result:** Let's see how to [Create a page](./create-a-page.md).

## Images

Regular Markdown images are supported.

You can use absolute paths to reference images in the static directory (`static/img/logo.png`):

```md
![Docusaurus logo](/img/logo.png)
```

![Docusaurus logo](/img/logo.png)

You can reference images relative to the current file as well. This is particularly useful to colocate images close to the Markdown files using them:

```md
![Docusaurus logo](./img/logo.png)
```

## Code Blocks

Markdown code blocks are supported with Syntax highlighting.

````md
```jsx title="src/components/HelloD.js"
function HelloDocusaurus() {
  return <h1>Hello, Docusaurus!</h1>;
}
```
````
